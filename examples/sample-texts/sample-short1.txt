My favorite and inevitable application of QPUs is the simulation of physics. Physics simulations are ubiquitous. Gamers will know this well. When you think of video games, you should think of virtual worlds. These worlds have physical laws, and the motion of the objects and characters in the world needs to be calculated—this is a simulation. Physics must be simulated when designing aircraft, bridges, and any other engineered system. Physics is simulated in science, too—entire galaxies have been simulated to understand their formation. But quantum physics has resisted simulation because CPUs are really bad at it.
